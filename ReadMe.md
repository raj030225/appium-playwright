Now let's install all the required dependencies:

Great! I've created a complete automation framework that supports both web and mobile testing. Here's what I've set up:

Project Structure:

│   ├── features/
│   │   ├── web/
│   │   │   └── login.feature
│   │   └── mobile/

│   └── utils/
│       ├── WebDriver.ts
│       └── MobileDriver.ts
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── cucumber.js


Features:
Web: A sample login feature
Mobile: A sample calculator feature
To run the tests:
For web tests: npm run test:web
For mobile tests: npm run test:mobile
For the mobile tests to work, you'll need:

Appium server running (appium in a separate terminal)
An Android emulator or real device connected
A calculator app (the path should be set in the MOBILE_APP_PATH environment variable)
You can run web tests right away as they use a sample website (example.com).

The framework uses:

TypeScript for type safety
Playwright for web automation
Appium with WebdriverIO for mobile automation
Cucumber for BDD-style testing
Page Object Model pattern for better maintainability
